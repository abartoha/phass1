            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                I am Christine. I have graduated from Beloit College with an M.Sc. in Nutritions Science.
                I have been practising as a dietician for 7 years and I am confident enough 
                to help you in your healthy eating journey.
                <br> <br>

                I have helped numerous other people in losing their excess fats, maintaining
                good faith with their meals during health crisis and pushed athletes into their
                peak performance.
                <br> <br>
                My hobby is gunsmithing and my favourite past time is shooting.
